Los metodos que terminan con un !(por ejemplo, println!) son MACROS de Rust.
Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.

## Cargo
Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. 
In Rust, packages of code are referred to as crates.
Cargo expects your source files to live inside the src directory.
The top-level project directory is just for README files, license information, configuration files, and anything else not related to your code.
